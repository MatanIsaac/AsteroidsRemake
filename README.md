### <div align="center">Disclaimer</div>

 
    
This project was inspired by the One Lone Coder [Asteroids Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgDR8LrRZhk)

Recreated with SDL2 instead of the [olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine).



### <div align="center">Brief Description of the Project </div>
   
    
Developed over a few days as an engaging side project while pursuing my Computer Science studies.

I chose to use the GLM library for 2D vector manipulation for its ease of use, although it might seem a bit of an overkill for a simple game. 


<div align="center">    
The Game Objective, and Gameplay Mechanics
</div>

    A simple remake, destroy all the asteroids to win, if you get hit by an asteroid you lose. 
    accelerate with the 'UP' key and rotate with 'LEFT' 'RIGHT, Press 'SPACE' to shoot bullets.   


### <div align="center">Libraries Used</div>

The libraries comes with the project so no need to download them yourself.


    (included in the repo)
    SDL2 library
    SDL2 extensions: SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer, SDL2_ttf
    OpenGL Mathematics (GLM) library 

## <div align="center">Installation</div>


Download Game (Binaries): Get the pre-built game. Download the zip file containing the executable (bin) from [release-link].


### <div align="center">Building from Source</div>


This project is primarily developed using Microsoft Visual Studio Community. 

If you're working with a different IDE, you might need to adjust the setup to compile and run the game. 

This involves configuring the environment to match the dependencies and settings used in Visual Studio.

### <div align="center">Final Notes</div>


This project, while small in scale, embraces the open-source philosophy. 

A few finishing touches are still to be dealt with, in order to make this game complete. 

Here's a TODO List: (Done tasks are marked with - ![icons8-ok-16](https://github.com/MTN95/AsteroidsRemake/assets/113786893/0b1a5b0b-cfce-4f5f-b59c-95b3b91507e2))
    
 1. Implement a Scoring System. ![icons8-ok-16](https://github.com/MTN95/AsteroidsRemake/assets/113786893/0b1a5b0b-cfce-4f5f-b59c-95b3b91507e2)
 2. Define a Victory Condition. ![icons8-ok-16](https://github.com/MTN95/AsteroidsRemake/assets/113786893/0b1a5b0b-cfce-4f5f-b59c-95b3b91507e2)
 3. Incorporate Randomization to The Game. ![icons8-ok-16](https://github.com/MTN95/AsteroidsRemake/assets/113786893/0b1a5b0b-cfce-4f5f-b59c-95b3b91507e2)
